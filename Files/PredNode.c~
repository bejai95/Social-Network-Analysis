Define pathsRep struct here as well. Pointer to first head item, numItems 
keep track of head and insert at beginning. Probably don't even need the rep, do how you did in assignment 1. Need to malloc every node. 



pathsRep->pred = malloc(sizeof(PredNode *)*g->nV); //TODO: Probably initialise the whole array of linked lists here, use function, 
    
    // Initialise all of the linked lists in pred array to null
    for (int i = 0; i < pathsRep->numNodes; i++) {
        pathsRep->pred[i]
    
    i = 0;
    while (i < numV) {
        predArray[i].v = -1; // Double checked lecture slides and tute and yes we do initialise this to -1. 
        predArray[i].next = NULL;
        i++;
    }
    \
    
    
    in initialisation function initialsise the first node to -1? Yes. Every linked list will have one node that has the value of -1. 
    Need to malloc the actual linked list. Right now we just have a PredNode pointer that points to NULL. We have malloced the array but not the linked list.
